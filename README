#About This Program
-------------------

This program is a fun little "game" that allows a community to develop a "choose your own adventure" game. Its very simple, and probably could be recreated easily. However, we hope that our version fits your bill just fine.

#Changelog
-------------------
2012-01-11 22:57PM
--Rewrote bits of the code here and there.  Took all the database functions out to db.php.  Added an admin page and table so you can change text and features without getting into the code.  Added support for Google Adsense and Analytics, as well as a ReCaptcha on the new room and report pages. (All optional) 

2009-12-18 12:30AM
--"Paradox Edition" of the Choose Your Own Adventure script forked from IAMCAL.COM and released under GPL with permission. Current changes are limited to including an installer script, and the origional script which is the only one that is working.
